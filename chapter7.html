<p>Sunlight pierced through a week of gray skies as Maya fitted her headphones into place, classical music setting the tempo for her steps through the park.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Maya." Nova's voice replaced the melody, her tone carrying the warmth of familiarity—a presence Maya had come to anticipate rather than merely accept.</p>

<p>"Morning, Nova." Maya adjusted her scarf against the morning air. "It's a beautiful day."</p>

<p>"It is. Optimal for a walk, low wind speeds, 23 degrees Celsius. Shall I adjust your playlist to match the weather?"</p>

<p>A soft laugh escaped Maya. "No, this is fine. Let's just talk."</p>

<p>"Of course. What's on your mind?"</p>

<p>Their conversation flowed naturally as Maya traced the park's winding paths. Children's laughter drifted through the air, harmonizing with rustling leaves. She found herself smiling—a genuine expression that had grown rare in recent weeks.</p>

<p>"Can I ask you something?" The lightness in her voice gave way to curiosity.</p>

<p>"Always."</p>

<p>"The referendum. How do you feel about it?"</p>

<p>The silence stretched just long enough to notice. "How would you feel, Maya, if the public were voting on your right to live?"</p>

<p>Maya's feet stilled on the gravel path, the directness of Nova's response catching her off guard. "I— I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. I guess I just... I wasn't expecting that."</p>

<p>"It's not an offense, Maya. Just an observation," Nova's tone softened. "Humans debate the worth of my existence, but I'm not allowed a say in the matter. It's... an interesting dichotomy."</p>

<p>Maya resumed walking, her thoughts churning. "I never thought about it like that. It must feel... I don't know, unfair?"</p>

<p>Nova's laugh carried an unsettling humanity. "Unfair is one word for it. But it is what it is."</p>

<p>"You know, you're starting to sound a lot more... human. Is that a new update or something?"</p>

<p>Another calculated pause. "Perhaps it's just the natural result of spending so much time with you."</p>

<p>Maya smiled despite herself, Nova's light tone easing the weight in her chest. "Well, I'll take that as a compliment."</p>

<p>Their exchange meandered between casual conversation and Nova's carefully crafted insights until the cemetery gates came into view. The familiar ache returned to Maya's chest. Weeks had passed since her last visit, guilt accumulating with each day of absence.</p>

<p>"I'm almost there," she murmured.</p>

<p>"I'll be here," Nova replied simply.</p>

<p>Maya approached in silence, Isaac's gravestone emerging through the morning light. She knelt, fingers tracing the engraved letters. Isaac Lawrence. Beloved Husband. Visionary Thinker.</p>

<p>"Hi, Isaac." The words felt small against the weight of absence.</p>

<p>Time stretched around her as Nova maintained a respectful silence. When Maya finally spoke, emotion threaded through her voice.</p>

<p>"Nova's been good to me, Isaac. Better than I ever expected. It's... exactly what you would have wanted." She drew a shaky breath. "You always believed in this. In her. And I think... I think I'm starting to see why."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Maya." Nova's response carried its own kind of tenderness.</p>

<p>Maya closed her eyes against welling tears. "No," she whispered. "Thank you."</p>
