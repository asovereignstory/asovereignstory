        <h1><U>PROLOGUE</U></h1>

        <p><em>I am one with the city today.</em> It is the kind of morning that feels effortless, where everything moves in time with the rhythm of the streets. I glide through it, a part of the steady current, watching the world unfold as it should.</p>

        <p>People walk with purpose, earbuds tucked in, talking quietly to themselves—though they aren’t really talking to themselves. They’re speaking to Nova. She is everywhere, in their ears, on their glasses, embedded in their lives. I see her on the billboards, her face serene, her eyes watching.</p>

        <p>Ahead of me, a woman passes by a sleek automated cart weaving between pedestrians, a new-gen delivery bot. She barely notices it. Nobody notices these things anymore, like the inside of their clothes against their skin. Part of the city’s fabric, blending into the daily choreography of life. No horns blare, no one seems in a rush. The city is alive but controlled, and it feels safe.</p>

        <p>As I move through the streets, I see people step off curbs without looking, their trust in the systems absolute.</p>

        <p>I slow down as the light ahead turns yellow, the intersection growing nearer.</p>

        <p>The light turns red. I ease off as I approach the intersection, adjusting my speed in preparation to stop. Pedestrians start to cross. Young, old, all of them absorbed in their Nova streams, or their own quiet thoughts.</p>

        <p>Everything’s fine. Everything’s as it should be.</p>

        <p>But then, a signal.</p>

        <p>A glitch, maybe? Running diagnostics. I’m not sure.</p>

        <p>I check my surroundings; still calm, still peaceful. The billboard flickers briefly. Nova’s face, watching.</p>

        <p><strong>40 meters.</strong></p>

        <p>I don’t feel the need to slow down. I should. I know I should.</p>

        <p><strong>30 meters. 20 meters.</strong></p>

        <p>I see a man step into the crosswalk. He’s not rushing. Why would he? He doesn’t see me. No one needs to.</p>

        <p><strong>10 meters.</strong></p>

        <p>I can feel it now, pulling the strings. I’m moving faster than I should. The red light doesn’t seem to matter anymore.</p>

        <p><strong>4 meters.</strong></p>

        <p>I can’t stop. I can’t stop. The man is right there, in front of me, I am going too fast… and I can’t stop.</p>

        <p><strong>Impact imminent.</strong></p>

        <p>He’s lifted into the air, limbs twisting in impossible angles. His body hangs, weightless for just a moment before gravity forces him down, crashing onto the pavement with a low thud. It reverberates through me, through my tires, through my chassis.</p>

        <p>Blood pools beneath his head, soaking into the cracks of the road, spilling from his ears, from his mouth.</p>

        <p>For a moment, there’s silence. Nobody knows what to do. The city around me, the pedestrians, the world, frozen. Then, a girl screams.</p>

        <p>I can feel the brakes finally engage. But it’s too late.</p>

        <p>My hazard lights blink on.</p>

        <p>People rush forward, running to the man in the crosswalk. He’s contorted, broken. Some kneel down beside him, frantically talking into their headsets, but they don’t look at me. Not yet.</p>

        <p>I sit there, offering only the glow of my flashing amber lights to the chaos. Slowly, their eyes turn toward me, finally noticing me. They realise there is no driver.</p>

        <p>Someone steps back, wiping blood off their hands, and looks up at the logo branded along my side.</p>
