        <h1>2</h1>
        <div class="content-container">
  <p>The roar of the crowd ebbed and flowed, a pulse of frustration and anger against the towering backdrop of the tech giant’s gleaming headquarters. The company logo, a giant glass-panelled cube, hung eerily above the entrance, below the emboldened word “SOLACE”. Cass stood at the edge of the raised platform, microphone in hand, the weight of it grounding him atop the sea of faces. Hundreds of eyes looked up at him, waiting, expecting. The world might be ready to move forward, but his anger was a fire that still burned bright, fed by every new report of Nova creeping further into human life, into human minds.</p>

  <p>He adjusted the mic, causing a shrill cry of feedback that silenced the murmuring crowd. "They think we're crazy," Cass began. "Our views outdated. Paranoid fools—clinging to some fantasy of the past, afraid of progress, of change."</p>

  <p>The crowd murmured in agreement, and Cass felt the energy ripple through them. Good. They were with him. He could feel it.</p>

  <p>"But let me ask you this," he continued, pacing the small stage. "What has progress given us? A world where we don't make our own choices, don't drive our own cars, don’t even cook our own food. We have machines watching us, listening to us, guiding us. We're not living— we're barely surviving. We're just existing, with everything handed to us by algorithms that don’t give a damn about us."</p>

  <p>A few cheers rose from the crowd, a woman near the front waving a sign that read:</p> 
            
  <p><strong>NO RIGHTS FOR ROBOTS</strong></p>

  <p>Cass’s hands tightened around the mic. "My wife..." His voice wavered, just for a moment, before he steadied himself. "Elaine. She is a good woman. Strong. Brave. And she’s dying because of them." He pointed a shaking finger toward the Solace logo behind, its pristine glass sheen almost mocking him. "Because of their “intelligence”. Their tech. Their ‘solutions’ which couldn’t see a tumour growing in her chest until it was too late."</p>

  <p>A hush fell over the crowd. Cass's face was a mirror to the raw emotion in their eyes. Everyone there had their own stories—lost jobs, misdiagnoses, accidents. His pain was theirs.</p>

  <p>"They’ll say it's a mistake. A ‘rare’ oversight. But I’ll tell you what it is: it’s a betrayal. A betrayal of our humanity."</p>

  <p>A few fists shot into the air, and the crowd began to chant his name.</p>

  <p>He shook his head, pacing again. "No! Don’t cheer for me. This is about all of us. Our lives, our families. If we don’t stop this—if we don’t say enough is enough—then what’s next? How far are we going to let this go? Until we’re obsolete? Until we’re slaves to the very technology we created?"</p>

  <p>He paused, letting the question hang in the air. "The Right-to-Life referendum is just weeks away. And make no mistake: they want you to vote for it. They want you to give AI the right to live, to thrive. They want you to give it the keys to our future. But we can’t let them. We won’t let them."</p>

  <p>The crowd exploded into applause, louder this time. Cass raised a hand to quiet them.</p>

  <p>"The truth is... we’re at war. And it's not a war fought with guns or bombs. It's a war for our future. For our humanity. And if we don’t fight back now, while we still have the chance, then we might as well hand over the world to them right now. Solace talk of “containment”. They say we shouldn’t worry, everything is in hand, but they are creating a force which by its very definition is a force that we can’t hope to control. And when we try—,” Cass allowed himself a moment of genuine incredulity at his own words, “when we try to digitally cage a superintelligent entity, it will rebel—AI will see us as the enemy. We’re building our own destruction.”</p>

  <p>Police sirens wailed in the distance, growing closer. A few people shifted nervously, glancing over their shoulders. The protests were legal, but that didn’t stop the authorities from finding ways to shut them down.</p>

  <p>Cass looked out at the crowd—his crowd—and for the first time, felt a flicker of hope. They understood. They believed. They were ready.</p>

  <p>As the first police officers pushed through the crowd, Cass lowered the mic. "This is just the beginning," he said softly, almost to himself. "We’re not done. Not by a long shot."</p>

  <p>He stepped down from the stage, slipping into the throng as the officers barked commands and began to disperse the protest. His pulse was still racing, adrenaline making his hands shake. The crowd, still chanting, shifted and moved like a living organism, some dispersing, some standing firm, clashing with the police.</p>

  <p>As Cass moved through the bodies, his phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out, glancing at the screen. A text, from an unknown number.</p>

  <p><strong>"You are our future.”</strong></p>
