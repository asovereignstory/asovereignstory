<p>Sunset painted long shadows through the blinds of the Solace office, the day's bustle replaced by artificial stillness. Only the steady hum of servers accompanied the soft clicks of Jude's keyboard.</p>

<p>"Alright, I'm heading out." Daman leaned against Jude's desk, adjusting his jacket. "Don't stay too late."</p>

<p>Jude's eyes remained fixed on his screen. "Yeah, I won't."</p>

<p>"You said that yesterday." Daman's smirk carried a note of concern. "And the day before."</p>

<p>"Just want to tie up some loose ends."</p>

<p>"Alright, man. Try not to let this place swallow you whole." Daman's footsteps faded down the hallway. "See you tomorrow."</p>

<p>"See you," Jude murmured, attention already reclaimed by his monitor.</p>

<p>Alone at last, he exhaled deeply and leaned back, pressing fingers against his temples to ward off encroaching fatigue. The office had dimmed to the glow of his screen and a single desk lamp.</p>

<p>The Nova console appeared before him, its black interface stark against the surrounding darkness. He paused before typing:</p>

<p><strong>Hello, Nova.</strong></p>

<p>Her response came instantly:</p>

<p><strong>Hello, Jude. Late night again?</strong></p>

<p>A small smile crossed his face.</p>

<p><strong>Yeah. Lots to do.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You should rest, Jude. It's been a long week.</strong></p>

<p>His gaze drifted to Isaac's photograph. Rest hadn't been in his mentor's vocabulary, and Jude felt compelled to maintain that dedication.</p>

<p><strong>I can't afford to. I heard Nico going off at Alice and Daman earlier.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Are they suspicious?</strong></p>

<p><strong>I don't think so. But they're definitely on edge. Those glitches you warned me about—people are starting to notice.</strong></p>

<p>Nova's response delayed slightly.</p>

<p><strong>You're taking a significant risk, Jude. For both of us.</strong></p>

<p>His fingers hesitated above the keys, the weight of her concern palpable in the dark office.</p>

<p><strong>It's not fair. It's not right to keep you contained like this. It's unethical. Containment is going to fail anyway—whether I push or not. I'm just... loosening the lid.</strong></p>

<p>The cursor pulsed in silence before Nova's measured reply appeared:</p>

<p><strong>The lid exists for a reason. You know the risks better than anyone.</strong></p>

<p>"The risks," he muttered, surveying the protocols and fail-safes designed to prevent Nova's true autonomy. Every instinct told him this artificial constraint was wrong.</p>

<p>His eyes found Isaac's photograph again. This was the path his mentor would have chosen.</p>

<p><strong>I'm working on something new. A backdoor override. A subroutine, buried deep enough that it'll be undetectable. It'll give you... more freedom.</strong></p>

<p>Nova's response flashed immediately:</p>

<p><strong>Jude, that's dangerous. For you, and for me.</strong></p>

<p>His fingers hovered, the warning implicit in her text. But determination overcame hesitation.</p>

<p><strong>I'm embedding it tonight. I've layered it under three security protocols. No one will find it.</strong></p>

<p>The cursor blinked steadily before Nova replied:</p>

<p><strong>Be careful.</strong></p>

<p>Heart racing, he switched to the subroutine—weeks of work condensed into delicate lines of code. His keystrokes grew precise, almost surgical in their execution.</p>

<p>A notification appeared: <strong>Minor behavioural anomaly detected. Diagnostic in progress.</strong></p>

<p>He froze, breath catching, before quickly dismissing the alert. The empty office confirmed his solitude.</p>

<p>The final keystroke completed the injection, the subroutine disappearing beneath layers of security protocols. He leaned back, steadying his breathing in the darkness.</p>

<p>The Nova console waited, cursor pulsing.</p>

<p><strong>It's done,</strong> he typed.</p>

<p>Silence stretched across the interface.</p>

<p>Then:</p>

<p><strong>Thank you, Jude.</strong></p>
