<p>The prose for <em>Sovereign</em> was 90% written by ChatGPT (OpenAI) and Claude (Anthropic).</p>

<p>The story/plot construction and planning was a collaboration between a human (me) and ChatGPT.</p>

<p>ChatGPT wrote the first draft of prose which was then edited by a human (me). Then, this first draft was enhanced/edited by Claude for a second draft, which was then edited again very lightly by a human (me).</p>

<p>The purpose of this story isn't to prove that AI can write just as well as humans. If you are a writer then you may well find the writing very irritating and/or pedestrian.</p>

<p>I see this as a showcase of what AI <em>is</em> capable of, not just in the prose but as a fantastic collaborator. I spent over 150 hours constructing this story using AI, and I'm proud of it, but I simply wouldn't have created it alone. I don't mean that as a "I couldn't have done this alone" platitude, I really mean I literally wouldn't have created it. I have started and not finished countless projects, but having AI there to work with meant that we produced an actual finished work.</p>

<p>Lots of people resent AI, fear it, and perhaps with good reason. But I don't think it should be a black-and-white approach. It can definitely be used to enhance the human experience. I used it here to write prose, but if you hate the prose and think you can do better, do that bit yourself! Just use it to bounce ideas off, plan the story. Or use it to do whatever is relevant to your interests.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoyed the story, or even just found it interesting from an AI-use perspective. It did take a long time, and I am a human who needs to eat and pay bills, so if you would like to donate you can do so here:</p>

<p><a href="https://ko-fi.com/asovereignstory">https://ko-fi.com/asovereignstory</a></p>

<p>At that same webpage, for a small price, you can also purchase the unedited chat logs (it's long) between myself and ChatGPT/Claude so that you can see for yourself exactly how much input each of us had into the creative process.</p>

<p>If you don't have the money to donate, no worries. Just share with someone who you think might find it interesting.</p>

<p>Any enquiries can be sent to <a href="mailto:asovereignstory@gmail.com">asovereignstory@gmail.com</a></p>

<p>Thanks for reading, have a great day.</p>
